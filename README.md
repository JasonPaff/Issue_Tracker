# Splatter

- **Purpose:** 
Splatter is a software solution that will allow a software development team to quickly and easily submit and track bug reports. Splatter utilizes a roles based system split between quality assurance accounts, developer accounts and admin accounts. A users role determines which dashboard you have access to and which features of the software you are able to interact with.
Quality Assurance

The quality assurance role is for the software testers who are finding and cataloguing the bugs and issues in the software. The qa tester will have access to the ticket submitting features of the software. The role also has the ability to view, sort and filter through any previous tickets they have submitted. The internal messaging system is also available to the qa support role.
Developer

The developer role is for the programmers who are actively working on closing tickets. The developer is able to see any tickets that have been assigned to them as well as any previously assigned tickets they have closed. The developer also has access to the internal messaging system.
Admin

The admin role is for the project manager and is charge of assigning newly created tickets to developers. The admin has access to all tickets in the system, past and present. The admin also has access to internal messaging system.
